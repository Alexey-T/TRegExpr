Some hints about opcode
-----------------------

How opcode handles groups in brackets?
Group can contain choices (vertical bars).
(expr1|expr2|expr3)expr
For each choice, opcode has OP_BRANCH node.
Entire group in inside OP_OPEN+i ... OP_CLOSE+i pair (i = absolute index of group).

  OP_OPEN+i
  OP_BRANCH (begin of branch 1) -> links to branch 2
  code (contents of branch 1)
  code
  code
  code                          -> last code links to OP_CLOSE+i
  OP_BRANCH (begin of branch 2) -> links to branch 3
  code
  code
  code
  code                          -> last code links to OP_CLOSE+i
  OP_BRANCH (last branch)       -> links to nothing
  code
  code
  code
  code                          -> last code links to OP_CLOSE+i
  OP_CLOSE+i                    -> links to opcode after group
  code
  code
  code

So how the code handles group? It calls MatchPrim for beginning of all branches.
In repeat-until. When any branch gives OK result, it goes to OP_CLOSE+i, then to next
opcode after group, and if all next opcode works ok, that old MatchPrim call gets True.
When repeat-until gets True for any branch, it found the ok choice.

How atomic groups are handled?
------------------------------

We handle OP_CLOSE+i, we are there when some branch matched. For atomic group,
we mark our group as "done". GrpAtomicDone[i]:=True.
Then opcode after group is run. If it gets False, code backtracks to that repeat-until.
For normal group, code goes to next choice.
For atomic group, code does NOT go to next choice, because it checks GrpAtomicDone[i].

How negative lookaround works?
-------------------------------
TODO: this is not fully implemented! (?<!foo)bar don't work.

Lookaround is also a group. Which is marked as "negative".

a) lookaround matched
We are in OP_CLOSE+i, we have some choice matched.
For negative group, we must discard the entire result.
So we return to OP_OPEN+i handler.
We make the total result False.

b) lookaround is not matched
That old repeat-until ended, no choice was ok.
This means that we must jump to opcode after lookaround.
We jump from OP_OPEN+i to OP_CLOSE+i, and jump to opcode after group.
