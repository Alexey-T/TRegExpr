Some hints about opcode
-----------------------

Group can contain choices: (expr1|expr2|expr3)expr.
For each choice, opcode has OP_BRANCH node.
Even if no choices, opcode has single OP_BRANCH.
Entire group in inside OP_OPEN+i ... OP_CLOSE+i pair (i = index of group).

  OP_OPEN+i                     -> links to branch 1
  OP_BRANCH (begin of branch 1) -> links to branch 2
  code (contents of branch 1)
  code
  code
  code (last)                   -> links to OP_CLOSE+i
  OP_BRANCH (begin of branch 2) -> links to branch 3
  code
  code
  code
  code (last)                   -> links to OP_CLOSE+i
  OP_BRANCH (last branch)       -> links to nothing
  code

  code (last)                   -> links to OP_CLOSE+i
  OP_CLOSE+i                    -> links to opcode after group

"Code goes to" means handler of one opcode calls MatchPrim for another opcode.
So how the code handles group? 
Code goes from OP_OPEN+i to first OP_BRANCH.
Handler of OP_BRANCH has repeat-until, it loops all next branches.
When any branch gives ok, it goes to OP_CLOSE+i, then to next opcode after group,
and if all next opcode gives ok, that old MatchPrim call gets True.
When repeat-until gets True on some loop, it found the ok choice.

How atomic groups are handled?
------------------------------

We handle OP_CLOSE+i, we are there when some choice matched. For atomic group,
we mark our group as "done". GrpAtomicDone[i]:=True.
Then code goes to opcode after the group.
If it gets False (regex after the group didn't match), code backtracks 
to that mentioned repeat-until.
For normal group, code goes to next choice.
For atomic group, code does NOT go to next choice, because it checks GrpAtomicDone[i].


Proposal: How negative lookaround must work
-------------------------------------------
This is not fully implemented! (?<!foo)bar don't work.

Negative lookaround is also a group. Which is marked as "negative".

a) Lookaround matched
We are in OP_CLOSE+i, so we have some choice matched.
For negative group, we must discard the entire result.
So we return to OP_OPEN+i handler.
We make the total result False.

b) Lookaround is not matched
That old repeat-until ended, no choice was ok.
This means that we must jump to opcode after lookaround.
- For (?<!foo)bar at regex start - jump to the actual regex.
- For foo(?!bar) at regex end - jump to OP_END and get True. 

We jump from OP_OPEN+i to OP_CLOSE+i (using links between branches),
and jump to opcode after group.


How recursion works
-------------------

Handler of OP_RECUR just goes to (calls MatchPrim) beginning of opcode
(after MAGIC byte).

How subroutine calls work
-------------------------

It's more complex than recursion because we need to quit handling of 
calling group when opcode goes to its end. So handler of OP_SUBCALL+i
goes to opcode of i-th group (pointer in GrpOpCodes[] array).
To quit handling of group at its end, we handle also OP_CLOSE+i, and
there we check that we are inside sub-call, "if GrpSubCalled[no]".
