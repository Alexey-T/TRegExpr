[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/masterandrey/TRegExpr.png)](https://travis-ci.org/masterandrey/TRegExpr)
### TRegExpr

### Delphi / Kylix / FreePascal(Lazarus) library for regular expressions.

Pure Object Pascal!


#### OUTDATED DOCUMENTATION

There is a very old translation of TRegExpr documentation in this git branch.
Literally from previous century.

This translation is just inside rst docs/files in this git branch.

New translation should be done with GetText, for example with 
[Transiflex](https://www.transifex.com/masterAndrey/tregexpr/dashboard/).

After that we would `pull_docs.sh` in `master`.

And change Admin / Advanced setting of appropriate TRegExpr 
[readthedocs subproject](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/)
default branch to `master`.
