Old items:

- "Russian Ranges" --> National ranges (use property WordChars ?
 for ordering letters in ranges by its order in WordChars if modifier /r is On)

- opcode optimization: remove BRANCH-to-EEND, COMMENT, BACK(?)

Alexey's:

- support WideChar surrogate pairs in unicode mode;
  it must find such pairs (with length=2) by:
  - dot
  - negatives \S \D \W \V \H
  - \p and \P

- maybe support \X, via implemented \p and \P (docs in web)
