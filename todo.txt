Old items:

- "Russian Ranges" --> National ranges (use property WordChars ?
 for ordering letters in ranges by its order in WordChars if modifier /r is On)

- opcode optimization: remove BRANCH-to-EEND, COMMENT, BACK(?)

Alexey's:

- maybe support \X, via implemented \p and \P (docs in web)

- negative assertion: (?<!foo)bar
  This needs 2nd helper object which will have its own regex '(foo)\Z'
  and it will find it after successful match of main object.
  Main object will find "bar".
